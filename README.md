🧠 Problem:
First-time home buyers often struggle to understand what really drives house prices. Similarly, real estate firms want to forecast pricing trends based on local features like tax rate, rooms per dwelling, etc.

💡 Solution:
Trained and compared multiple ML models on the Boston Housing dataset, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Performed feature scaling, encoding, and error evaluation. Explained the impact of variables through SHAP and partial dependence plots.

🔧 Tech Stack:

pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

seaborn for correlation plots

SHAP for model interpretability

Jupyter Notebook interface

📊 Impact:
Demonstrated a full ML workflow for regression modeling. Inspired peers in college to pick regression topics for final-year projects. Showed potential for building real-estate analytics dashboards.
